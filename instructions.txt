on my work machine:

cd /home/evyatar/work/prcc/angular/demo03
nvm version  (should yield: v20.5.0)
nvm use v20.5.0  
npm install
npm run build  (<== this is optional)
ng serve

then browse to
http://localhost:4200/


browse to this to see the Figma:

to deploy
---------
First, MAKE SURE everything is committed and pushed to git (otherwise you will loose your work!!!)

in console run:
./deploy.sh
(currently it deploys to github of evyatark, so all links are to that project)
- it will ask for the username and password (token) for github, which you MUST enter manually.
- if completed correctly, github will now deploy to gh-pages, you can see this task progress in https://github.com/evyatark/prcc/actions
- when action is completed, access https://evyatark.github.io/prcc/ (anyone can access from anywhere!)
