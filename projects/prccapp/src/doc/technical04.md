# TypeScript

TypeScript is a Programming Language like JavaScript, but with Strongly Typing, classes, etc.

Angular is designed to work with TypeScript. Most Angular courses and examples use TypeScript.

If you are familiar with JavaScript but not with TypeScript, it is recommended to familiarize yourself with it.
There is a lot of (free) material all over the internet.

The TypeScript code is transpiled to JavaScript. The deployed code is already in JavaScript, 
so it will be more difficult to debugb the deployed app (because you need to guess the mapping between the JavaScript and the TypeScript source).  
However, in the development environment it should be possible to debug directly in the TypeScript code.
